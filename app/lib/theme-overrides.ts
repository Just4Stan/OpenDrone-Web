 * `content/theme.json` is a flat map of custom property to value. It is emitted
 * as a `:root{}` block after the stylesheet, so it overrides the `@theme`
 * defaults without touching app.css. The stylesheet stays the designed baseline
 * and this file is the diff on top of it, which means `git diff content/` shows
 * exactly what was changed and deleting the file restores the original design.
 *
 * Loaded through a glob rather than a direct import so a missing or empty file
 * is simply "no overrides" instead of a build error.
